# Language-Automation-with-Zapier-Integration

### Description:
This GitHub repository showcases a remarkable prompt engineering project where I leveraged cutting-edge language models and integrated them with Zapier's natural language processing capabilities. The primary goal was to streamline and automate various natural language tasks, paving the way for efficient communication and workflow optimization.

### Key Features:
OpenAI Language Model: The project harnesses the power of OpenAI's language model (specifically langchain.llms.OpenAI) to process natural language queries and generate intelligent responses.

Zapier Integration: I integrated Zapier's natural language understanding through the langchain.utilities.zapier.ZapierNLAWrapper, enabling seamless communication between the language model and Zapier's automation workflows.

Agent Initialization: The project showcases the efficient initialization of agents using langchain.agents.initialize_agent, customizing the agent with relevant tools and settings.

Task Execution: The script in this repository demonstrates the execution of various natural language tasks. The language model performs tasks such as email summarization, tweet generation, and drafting personalized responses.

### Project Highlights:
- Task 1: Summarize the last email received from Sabrina at Botpress and send the summary to the i-read-this domains channel in the dbt slack.

- Task 2: Get the last email received from Conrad, the research specialist. Summarize the interaction and create a tweet.

- Task 3: Get the last email received from Austin Belcak. Create a draft email in Gmail with a positive reply.

- Task 4: Get the last email received from Austin Belcak. Find a suitable gif that matches the email's intent and send it to the i-made-this channel in the dbt slack.

- Task 5: Create a tweet saying "langchain + zapier is great". Draft a professional email (up to 40 words) to allansema94@gmail.com, sharing the tweet with a personalized message.

### Project Demonstration:
Due to the nature of the language model and the integration with Zapier, a live demo or screenshots may not be available in this repository. However, I am more than willing to provide a detailed walkthrough during discussions or interviews.

### Usage:
The project code is organized and well-documented, making it easy for developers and AI enthusiasts to understand and experiment with similar prompt engineering projects. The script can be executed in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed.

### Technologies and Libraries:
Python
langchain package
OpenAI GPT-3.5 Language Model
Zapier NLA (Natural Language Automation) API
Acknowledgments:
I express my gratitude to OpenAI and Zapier for providing the powerful language model and natural language automation capabilities, respectively, which made this project possible.

### Conclusion:
This GitHub repository reflects my proficiency in prompt engineering and my ability to integrate AI-driven language models with automation tools like Zapier. It exemplifies how innovative ideas and emerging technologies can converge to create efficient, time-saving, and intelligent solutions for real-world problems. Please feel free to reach out for any further information or collaboration opportunities.
